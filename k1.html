            <h3>Key Topics to Cover:</h3>

            <h4>Grammar and Syntax:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Parts of Speech:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nouns: Person, place, thing, or idea (e.g., teacher, city, book, happiness).</li>
                        <li>Pronouns: Replace nouns (e.g., he, she, it, they).</li>
                        <li>Verbs: Action or state of being (e.g., run, swim, is, are).</li>
                        <li>Adjectives: Describe nouns (e.g., beautiful, large, bright).</li>
                        <li>Adverbs: Modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs (e.g., quickly, very).</li>
                        <li>Prepositions: Show relationships between nouns (e.g., on, in, under).</li>
                        <li>Conjunctions: Link words or clauses (e.g., and, but, because).</li>
                        <li>Interjections: Express emotions or feelings (e.g., Wow!, Ouch!).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Importance of Parts of Speech:</strong> Knowing parts of speech helps students construct complex sentences and enhances writing. Each part has a unique function that ensures sentence clarity.</p>

            <h4>Sentence Structure:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simple Sentences:</strong> Subject + Verb (e.g., The dog barked).</li>
                <li><strong>Compound Sentences:</strong> Two independent clauses connected by a conjunction (e.g., I went to the store, and I bought milk).</li>
                <li><strong>Complex Sentences:</strong> One independent clause and one or more dependent clauses (e.g., I stayed home because it was raining).</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Significance of Sentence Structure:</strong> Mastery of sentence structure allows students to convey clear, flowing ideas. Students should practice combining sentences and using punctuation correctly.</p>

            <h4>Comprehension:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reading for Understanding:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identify Main Ideas: Understand the central message of a passage.</li>
                        <li>Find Supporting Details: Recognize facts, examples, or arguments that support the main idea.</li>
                        <li>Inference: Read between the lines to make logical conclusions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Understanding Comprehension:</strong> Comprehension is about grasping deeper meanings, not just reading words. Diverse reading materials help students refine comprehension skills and apply them in various contexts.</p>

        <h2>Module 1: Crop Cultivation & Soil Management</h2>
        
        <h3>Theory: Understanding Soil and Crop Growth</h3>
        
        <h4>1. Types of Soil:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Loamy Soil:</strong> This soil is a mixture of sand, silt, and clay. It's good for most crops because it holds water but drains well. It is easy to work with and provides enough nutrients.</li>
          <li><strong>Sandy Soil:</strong> It drains water quickly, which is good for crops that need less water. However, it lacks nutrients and needs extra fertilizers.</li>
          <li><strong>Clay Soil:</strong> Holds water and nutrients, but doesn't drain well. It can be hard to work with but is good for crops that need moisture.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>How to Identify Good Soil:</h4>
        <p>Grab a handful of soil. Squeeze it. If it holds together, it’s good. If it falls apart, it needs compost or organic matter added.</p>

        <h4>What Your Soil Needs:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Organic Matter:</strong> This can be compost, farmyard manure, or green manure. It helps improve soil fertility and structure.</li>
          <li><strong>Nutrients:</strong> Crops need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium for healthy growth. You can add fertilizers or use crop rotation to keep the soil healthy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Practical: Preparing the Soil for Planting</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Step 1: Clear the Field:</strong> Remove weeds and old crops. This will reduce competition for nutrients.</li>
          <li><strong>Step 2: Test Soil pH:</strong> Use a simple pH test kit. Most crops grow well in soil with a pH of 6-7. If the soil is too acidic (pH below 5), add lime; if it's too alkaline (above 7), add sulfur.</li>
          <li><strong>Step 3: Ploughing and Tilling:</strong> Use a hoe or plough to break the soil into smaller pieces. This helps aerate the soil and allows roots to grow deeper.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Hands-On Activity:</h3>
        <p><strong>Planting Crops:</strong> Show how to plant seeds properly—deep enough but not too deep. For example, plant maize about 2–3 cm deep, while beans should be planted about 3–5 cm deep.</p>

        <h3>Real-Life Example:</h3>
        <p>If you're planting maize, make sure the soil is well-drained, loamy, and rich in nutrients. If it's clay soil, mix in some sand and compost to improve drainage.</p>

        <h3>Theory: Identifying Common Pests and Diseases</h3>
        
        <h4>1. Common Crop Pests:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Termites:</strong> Destroy plant roots and stems. If you see a plant wilting, check for termites at the base of the plant.</li>
          <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> Tiny insects that suck plant juices, causing leaves to curl. You’ll often find aphids on the underside of leaves.</li>
          <li><strong>Cutworms:</strong> These pests cut off plants near the soil surface.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Common Crop Diseases:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Blight:</strong> Appears as dark spots on leaves, especially in tomatoes and potatoes.</li>
          <li><strong>Rust:</strong> Looks like orange or brown spots on leaves.</li>
          <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> White, powdery spots appear on leaves.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h3>Practical: Managing Pests and Diseases Naturally</h3>

        <h4>1. Preventive Measures:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Change the crops you grow in a specific area every season. This helps prevent pests and diseases that target one particular crop.</li>
          <li><strong>Healthy Soil:</strong> Healthy soil leads to strong plants, which are less likely to be attacked by pests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Using Natural Pest Control:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Neem Oil:</strong> Neem oil can be sprayed on plants to kill pests without harming the environment. It is effective against aphids, termites, and other insects.</li>
          <li><strong>Soap and Water Spray:</strong> Mix soap and water in a spray bottle. Spray on plants to kill aphids and soft-bodied insects.</li>
          <li><strong>Companion Planting:</strong> Plant marigolds or garlic with your crops. They naturally repel pests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hands-On Activity:</h3>
        <p><strong>Identifying and Treating Pests:</strong> Show farmers how to look for signs of pests (such as holes in leaves or yellowing). Have them practice spraying neem oil or soap water on a few plants.</p>
